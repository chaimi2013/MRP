# MRP
[Fast Haze Removal for Nighttime Image Using Maximum Reflectance Prior](https://chaimi2013.github.io/Research/NighttimeDehazing/index.html), CVPR 2017.

The code has been tested on Win7/10 with Opencv 2.7.

## Installation
Please install opencv 2.4.9 (or copy "opencv_core249.dll" "opencv_highgui249.dll " "opencv_imgproc249.dll" from "OPENCV_DIR/build/x64/vc10/bin/" to the same directory with "NighttimeDehaze.exe") before running this code.

Then, run the executable code as: "NighttimeDehazeMRP.exe name.bmp 0", where "name.bmp" is the input nighttime hazy image, the follwowing parameter indicates the algorithm being used, e.g., 0 for MRP and 1 for MRP-Faster, the output dehazed result is named as "name_J.bmp".
